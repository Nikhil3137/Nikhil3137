## 🧠 About Me

I am a Generative AI / AI Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing and deploying production-grade LLM applications, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and agentic workflows.  
I specialize in building scalable AI backends, secure APIs, and cloud-deployed intelligent systems that solve real-world business problems.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **Generative AI, backend engineering, and MLOps**.
